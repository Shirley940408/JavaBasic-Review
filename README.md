# variable
## The beginning of Java
### File format 
- package name, 
- class name (need to be the same with file name, for it is .java doc)
- if you need this file itself to be executable:
```Java
package com.company;

public class Variable {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  // write your code here
  System.out.println("Hello World");
  int num1 = 10;
  int num2 = 10/4; //2.5->2 
  int num3 = -10/4; //-2.5->-|2.5->2|=-2
  //int: for Java is a Static type language.
  }
}
  /*Common classification of language:
  Static type: Java, C++, C#,
  Dynamic type： JavaScript, Python,
  */
```
### The classification of different valiabilities
- byte, (-2^7, 2^7 - 1)
- int, (-2^31, 2^31 - 1)
- short, (-2^15, 2^15 - 1)
- long, (-2^63, 2^63 - 1)
- float, single precision
- double, double precision
- char, saved as interger called "unicode" in bottom layer
- boolean, true or false
```Java
int year = 2018; //-(2^31) to 2^31
long big = 10000000000L; //-(2^63) to 2^63
double doubleNum = floatNum 
//a small range could be changed automatically 
float floatNum = (float) doubleNum; 
//large range cannot be changed to small range type unless using force change method.
boolean switchOne = true;
boolean switchTwo = false;
char ch1 ='a';
char ch2 =' ';
char ch3 =',';
//the char above is called "normal character".
//the char below is called "Escape character"
char ch4 ='\n';//enter after print
char ch5 ='\t';
char ch6 ='\r';
int uniNum = ch1;//uniNum->97
//char character is being saved in interger called unicode in the bottom layer of computer. When it is //given to an interger type variability, the num would appear.
```
#### e.g. Calculate whether a year is the leap year or not.
```Java
private static void LeapYear(int year){
  if (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0){
      System.out.println("Yes, this year is a Leap year.") ;
  }else{
      System.out.println("No, this year is not a Leap year.") ;
  }
}
```

## Starting with an Array
```Java
public static void main(String[] args){
    int[] score = {90, 95, 92, 89, 100, 90};
    int firstScore = score[5];
    score[0] = 30;
    int sum;
    for(int i = 0; i < score.length; i++) {
        sum += score[i];
    }
}
//score.length is valid in Java, as score is an Array.
```
### multi-dimention Array
```Java
int[][] matrix = new int[][]{
{1, 4, 7},
{2, 15, 13},
{6, 8, 12},
};
int [][] anotherMatrix = new int[4][4];
```
# function
## format of a function
```Java
 boolean findNumber(int[] array, int target){
    for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
      if (target == array[i]){
          return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
 }
```
### something must have in a function:
#### - return type： boolean (if this function does not have a return value, then put void as is return type)
#### - function name -- lower camel case, always start with a verb
#### - every parameter type need to be settled: int [] array, int target
#### - if this function has a return value, then always written in the **outermost layer** of the function.(Something you have writen in the switch method like if(){...;return value;}, but it will cause error unless you write another return in the outermost layer)

## String
### get the length of a String

```java
String str = "a string";
System.out.println(str.length());
//length vs. length()
//.length is used in an Array, and length() is used in a String
```
### The traverse of String
```Java
String str ="a string";
for(int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++){
char ch =str.charAt(i);
//...
}
```
## What is Object - Oriented ?
- Object-Oriented is a kind of world view
- Object-Oriented is a way to design program
### as an Object, it always has two things:
- attritube--member parameter
- behavior -- member function
## what is class
- Class is the abstract of Object. Object is an instance of the class.
- type of class name -- upper camel case
### constructor function
- has the same name of class
- does not have the return type, for it does not have return value
- cannot be visited from outside
- constructor function is called automatically when the object being initialized.
- constructor function has the overload（重载）
### this
- to avoid the misleading of parameter brought from outside and the class attributes.
- let the attributes always point to this object 
```Java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Student stu = new Student("Jack", 89);
        stu.speak();

    }
}

class Student{
    public String name;
    public int score;
    public Student(String name, int score){
        this.name = name;
        score = score;// it would not get the 89 from outside, cause this is missing.
    }
     public void speak(){
        System.out.println(name +" "+ score);
     }
}
```
